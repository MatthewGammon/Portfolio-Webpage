## Project Information
**This is my Portfolio Webpage for my final assignment in the Thinkful Software Engineering Prep Course.**
This project makes use of HTML and CSS to create a basic web page that is not responsive. 

### Project Goals
This project will be left alone as a reference for future progress. 
Any future projects should incoporate a mobile first approach and be fully responsive.
