        <h3 id="about-me">An Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          My name is <b>Matthew Gammon</b> and I am web development student
          living in <b>Norway, Maine.</b>
        </p>

        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          As a newcomer to the field of web development, I have already found
          that I enjoy the process of designing and creating web pages and
          applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bringing things to life that you are able to share with the world is
          both exciting and rewarding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seeing what I am able to create on my own has me excited to see what
          is possible when collaborating with others.
        </p>
        <p>
          I look forward to working with other members of my cohort to create
          interesting, organized, and visually appealing projects!
        </p>
        <p>
          Web development is my newest interest, but I have many others
          including:
        </p>
        <!-- creates an unordered list (to be displayed with bullet points)-->
        <ul>
          <li>
            Listening to music and attending concerts. My favorite genres are
            progressive metal and progressive rock.
          </li>
          <li>Physical fitness such as hiking, running, and cycling.</li>
          <li>
            Playing video games. Albion Online, Valheim, and Mythgard are some
            of my recent favorites.
          </li>
        </ul>
